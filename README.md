# PSO Unreal Engine 5 Fov Changer (Educational Purposes)

PSO Fov Changer, It will only work in training since its for educational purposes. To use it:

pip install -r requirements.txt

python 3.13 and above should work. address might change in the newer updates but meh idc.

I didn't have C/C++ Build Tools and I am too lazy to download so its in Python.

I DONT RECOMMEND USING IT. ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES!!!
